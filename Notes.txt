Notes

10/01/2018
12:50 - 15:20	Get re-acquanted with code for newton rapshon dic (dicNR and NRtracking3)
				Although the derivation of the getJac functions in NRtracking3 seem to be legit (according to paper Deformation 
				Measurement by DIC: Implementation of a second-order displacement gradient) they do not converge the P values
18:00 - 17:00	Try add a progress bar to dicNR so that you can see the progress of a pictures correlation since it can be slow
				Figured out you must do (-jacky') instead of (-jacky)' for the hessian

14/01/2018
14:00 - 16:00	Determine if zero-mean sum of squared difference (getJac5) is working (check what correlation values it is giving)
				Write function getJac6 in NRtracking3.m to perform normalised sum of squared difference NR
				change P=P+dP to P=P-dP ( which is consistent with the papers)
				write getJac7 which has the full derivatives (to see if this has an effect)
				~ robustness of the NR algorithm is an issue (also needs considerable ram for coefficients)
				Created getJac8 which is normalised cross correlation 

				getJac6 breaks down at image 3 whether it is P+dP or P-dP
				getJac7 +/- (+0.2) fails at image 3 - for (-0.2 it gets to like 0.049 ish ~ breaks down in the same way at image 6 (0.0756))

16/01/2018
10:50 - 19:00	correlate using lucas kanade (using same parameters) so that these results can be compared to those of Newton Raphson to figure
				out what is going wrong.
				Using the lucas-kanade (zero-mean) results the getJac5 NR algorithm (P+0.4*dP) converges to the required correlation value (0.005)
				Reading and trying to understand "newton-type methods" and how they use cholesky to improve convergence
				Tried to implement cholesky to improve stability but it doesnt work. The cholesky factor (matrix) becomes complex and so its breaks down


17/01/2018
11:20 - 14:00	Continue working on cholesky implementation.
				Look into line search methods (golden section) - seems to work initially but can get stuck at an unacceptable 
				correlation coefficient (with getJac6) (same with getJac5) - the hessian doesn't seem to allow the algorithm to
				make changes to the variable that needs to be changed (x disp) without also changing other variables so the 
				algorithm gets stuck since it cant improve the correlation coefficient.
15:30 - 17:30	Try to create getJac6_2 to only work with x and y disp but it gave a NaN jacobian and hessian
				Add an if statement in NRtracking3_temp to consider only the x/y disp if the norm of the stepChange is small - seems to work
				but it can cause a big increase in the correlation value.
				Changed algorithm (NRtracking3_temp) to first perform golden section for x and y disp and then all the variables - seems to
				give much quicker correlation (remember that the DIC data used is from a tension specimen so it is mostly x/y disp)

18/01/2018
11:30 - 16:00	Adjust exit condition for NRtracking3_temp so that it exits if the correlation coefficient doesn't change significantly and 
				it is still acceptable.

23/01/2018
11:40 - 14:10	Improve efficiency of dicNR_temp by only passing the interpolation coefficients that are relevant to the subset so that each worker
				uses less memory allowing more cores to be used.
				Created getJac6_eff so that normalised sum of square difference can be used more efficiently.
15:15 - 17:30	Write getJac1 to do zero-mean normalised sum of squared difference and test it out.
				Edit passing of interpolation coefficients in first iteration of NR (dicNR_temp) - wasn't working

24/01/2018
11:00 - 14:00	Edit passing of interpolation coefficients to take into account the displacement in the x and y directions so that the 
				correct area of coefficient values are passed. - not working, still tries coef matrix value outside of range

25/01/2018
11:00 - 13:30	Start writing section on Newton-Raphson method and try newtons method with absolute of hessian. (absolute of hessian does 
				not improve situation - can lead to slower convergence or none at all)
14:50 - 19:00	Considering how to finalise NR code so that its is more robust and corrects correlations with bad correlation coefficients.
				Try dicNR of zero-mean normalised sum of squared difference with stricter stopping condition to see if I get better results.
				Change NRtracking3_temp to try artificial search directions (and keep the best if it is better than the previous corr value) 
				when the norm of the step change is small.
				Was using xa=-10 and xb=10 in golden section line search without realising that the correlation coefficient might not be
				convex over this region - this is why algorithm often fails.
				Create function GoldenBracket to bracket the golden section search range- seem to improve stability
				Change stopping condition so that it is dependent more on the norm of the step change.
				Also only allow the hessian and jacobian to dictate the next iteration step if the funcval is not bigger than a multiple 
				of the previous funcval

26/01/2018
10:30 - 18:30	Work on stopping criteria in NRtracking3_temp.
				Improve bracketing function by trying many values and selecting the lowest-improved robustness (since there are so many dimensions
				the line of search in the dP direction is not guaranteed to be convex and it is unknown over what region it will be convex).

28/01/2018
11:20 - 17:30	Write section on Newton raphson - explain how determine hessian and jacobian.
				Try create outlier function to look for outliers and correct them.
				Add missing correlation coefficient to DICtracking2.m for lucas-kanade.
				Write function correctFloor.m to remove the D() operator in the hessian and jacobian of the light intensity values
				Try to figure out more efficient interpolation - got matrix multiplication working but it takes longer than using for loops

30/01/2018
10:30 - 15:00	Write section on golden section search method

31/01/2018
11:00 - 18:00	Rewrite Newton-raphson section and make congruent.
				Correct correlation equations in report

02/02/2018
12:20 - 15:00	Check methods for determining convexity of mutli-dimensional functions in bracketing algorithm. - not done much

04/02/2018
12:00 - 14:20	Create time plan on office 365 planner
				Create new dic.m file that performs both NR and LK using same call file.
				Try create NR_symbolic which is meant to create the functions for the Jacobian and Hessian in a similar manner to symbolic_warp
15:20 - 17:30	Continue working on NR_symbolic - got working
				Use correct floor to remove D() operators within NR_symbolic
				Check how to pass name of a function to a function (use str2func to convert string to function)

05/02/2018
10:30 - 13:00	got str2func working so that the warp function changes dynamically within the NR optmization algorithm (NRtracking4.m)
				create seperate function for golden section search
				made getjac functions change based on choice input to NRtracking4



TO DO:
1. For NR only determine coefficients for data that is close to the area of correlation to reduce memory usage and allow more cores to be used - done somewhat
2. Get NR working with interpolation based on F and not G (speed up process)
3. Rewrite getJac functions to be be more efficient - done
4. Pass the exit condition of the correlation step so that it can be improved upon later if need be.
5. Bracketing function for golden search to ensure search interval is convex
6. Machine learning/deep learning to adjust parameters of stopping criteria in NRtracking3_temp
7. Need to do LK_symbolic so that it is more robust for different warp functions
